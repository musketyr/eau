Nowadays there is plenty of *Unit, Test* and other testing frameworks which 
helps us to test nearly everything. There are also a lot of tools like continuous 
integration servers which helps us to report their results. But there is one 
important problem.  Are they all tests equal?

----
_*Implement vehicle based on given interface. The following features will be scored:*_
|| *Points* || *Requirements* ||
|| 4 || vehicle must change its direction appropriately when turning left or right ||
||  || *Bonus features* ||
|| 1 || vehicle might show proper blinker before and during turning left or right || 

----

Here we have desired interface:
{{{
public interface Vehicle {
    Direction getDirection();
    void turnLeft();
    void turnRight();
    void prepareTurnLeft();
    void prepareTurnRight();
    boolean isLeftBlinkerOn();
    boolean isRightBlinkerOn();
}
}}}
We can write a simple test to check whether student's implementation works as it 
should. It could look like one this:

{{{
public class VehicleTest01 {
    protected Vehicle fixture;
    
    // setup and other tests
    
    @Test public void testTurnRight(){
		Direction original = fixture.getDirection();
		fixture.turnRight();
		assertEquals(original.right(), fixture.getDirection());
    }
    
    @Test public void testPrepareRight(){
		Direction original = fixture.getDirection();
		fixture.prepareTurnRight();
		assertEquals(original, fixture.getDirection());
		assertTrue(fixture.isRightBlinkerOn());
		assertFalse(fixture.isLeftBlinkerOn());
    }
}
}}}

And here is the problem. Importance of testTurnRight is much higher than 
testPrepareRight, but there is no sign about this in the code. So there is no 
way how to find out how many points does particular student get until we match 
test results with the original assignment. But there can be some better way. We 
can make special annotations which will help us to have everything on one place. 
Look on next code snippet.

{{{
public class VehicleTest02 {

    protected Vehicle fixture;
    
    // setup and other tests
    
    @Points(2)
    @Test public void testTurnRight(){
		Direction original = fixture.getDirection();
		fixture.turnRight();
		assertEquals(original.right(), fixture.getDirection());
    }
    
    @Points(0.5)
    @Test public void testPrepareRight(){
		Direction original = fixture.getDirection();
		fixture.prepareTurnRight();
		assertEquals(original, fixture.getDirection());
		assertTrue(fixture.isRightBlinkerOn());
		assertFalse(fixture.isLeftBlinkerOn());
    }   
}
}}}

We can even provide lot of more useful informations like tasks description and
that some test is testing bonus feature. Bonus feature is as expected the one which
gives some extra points.

{{{
public class VehicleTest03 {

    protected Vehicle fixture;
    
    // setup and other tests
    
    @Points(2)
    @Description("Vehicle changes direction to proper one after turning right")
    @Test public void testTurnRight(){
		Direction original = fixture.getDirection();
		fixture.turnRight();
		assertEquals(original.right(), fixture.getDirection());
    }
    
    @Bonus @Points(0.5)
    @Description("Vehicle blinks right when preparing to turn right")
    @Details("Vehicle must keep original direction when preparing to turn")
    @Test public void testPrepareRight(){
		Direction original = fixture.getDirection();
		fixture.prepareTurnRight();
		assertEquals(original, fixture.getDirection());
		assertTrue(fixture.isRightBlinkerOn());
		assertFalse(fixture.isLeftBlinkerOn());
    }
}
}}}
